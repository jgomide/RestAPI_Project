# RestAPI_Project

A basic WEB API project using ASP.NET tenologies and REST concepts to improve my knowloge on C# / .NET Core.

To implemented this API solution I used Entity Framework with Migration to interact with SQL Express Database. I also used Swagger to help with the pratical tests and good interactive documentation. Last but not least I'm implementing JWT to learn how to interct with this tecnology.

This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

```bash
* [ASP.NET CORE REST API](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/apis). 
* Migrations Entity Framework - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/?tabs=dotnet-core-cli
* Swagger - https://swagger.io/about/
* JWT - https://jwt.io/
```
